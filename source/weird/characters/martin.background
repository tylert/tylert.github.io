Karl,

Here's a snippet from an old field entry I managed to scare up from
archives.  Sorry it sounds like some high school flunky's homework but at
least it'll help you with some of the missing background information you
wanted.

Mr. Anthony Martin Lefevbre Jr. was born on October 11th, 1977.  His
biological mother left him with his father soon after he was born.  She
disappeared soon after Mr. Lefevbre's birth and has never been heard from
again.  Mr. Lefevbre was only 10 years old when his father passed away due
to natural causes.  His step-mother looked after him until he was old
enough to be granted access to the money that he inherited from his late
father.  Mr. Lefevbre now lives by himself in his large mansion.

Mr. Lefevbre grew up in a rich Ottawa neighbourhood.  At a very young age,
he discovered he had a natural afinity for manipulating people.  He
learned very quickly how to use his gift to get what he wanted.  His
troubled family life taught him that the only person worth looking out for
was himself.  As a result, he has very few close friends and there are
even fewer people priviledged enough to call him "Martin".  He soon earned
a reputation among his classmates as a person best not to cross.  When he
was in high school, Mr. Lefevbre ran for school president and was elected
each year for 5 consecutive years until he graduated in June 1996.  He
never pursued any formal, civilian post-secondary education.

After he graduated, Mr. Lefevbre soon found work as an administrative
assistant working at Ottawa City Hall.  With his talents put to use to
further his own personal political gain, Mr. Lefevbre soon earned the
attention of the elite in his circle of power.  After only months, he was
offered a position as Senior In Charge Of Public Relations for Nortel.
