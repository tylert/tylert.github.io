Agent:  Mead, Skip Kyle

The Order believed that it had traced a rash of alarming media events in recent
years about some unexplained religious phenomena to a closely-knit group of
mages living near a Dominican monestary in a small village in central Europe.
This group of mages had been causing the local populace to witness several
near-religious experiences over an extended period of time in their attempts to
rekindle the dying faith.  The Order wished to know more about how and why
these things were happening so, Mr. Mead, a specialist in infiltration
techniques, was sent by the Order into deep cover to be accepted into this den
of reality deviants.  There, he remained for many years.

During his stay in the village, Mr. Mead is believed to have been captured and
tortured by these mages.  While he was left with no physical damage, a drastic
change in his personality soon manifested itself.  He had no conscious
knowledge of this and it seems that he was brainwashed and was suffering from a
severe dissociative disorder.  Our technicians were able to reverse the loss of
his skills memories and restore his mental stability but large portions of his
personality memories were apparently deliberately and irreparably altered by
his captors.

Before this time, this agent was an apprentice under Dr. Ricardo "Richard"
Vasquez, an NWO expert on the topic of standing-wave antineutrino
time-dilation.  Mr. Mead quickly demonstrated his apptitude for Dr.  Vasquez's
theories and soon became one of the chief researchers and experts in the fields
of relativistic chronological and dimensional annomalies and chaotic-spatial
relationships.

Due to his level of expertise in these subjects, Mr. Mead was chosen to lead a
special mission for an unrelated incident many years previous to his assignment
in Europe.  During this mission, Mr. Mead demonstrated his prowess at

Mr. Mead is still trying to deal with these gaps in his life.  He retains all
of his previous talents and skills and has even become more proficient at
thinking about extremely abstract theoretical conecpts such as those of chaos
and entropy after his trauma.
