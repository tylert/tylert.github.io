What's with all these references to "pilates" I keep seeing and hearing
everywhere?  Is this a mispronounciation of the word "pirates"?  Are we
suddenly being overwhelmed by roving bands of chinese weight-loss maurauders?

  "Walk the plank ye scuulvy dogs!"
  "We ale fielce pilates!"
  "Shivel me timbels!!!"
  "Alll, ye poxy landlubbels!"
  "You call those stomach clunches?!?"
