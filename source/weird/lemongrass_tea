13:50 < typhoon> ah... lemongrass tea... the flavours of fresh lemon and
                 freshly mown lawn combined
13:50 < typhoon> what will they think of next?
13:50 < Strogg> limegoat tea. :)
13:51 < dave0> industrial limegoat
13:51 < dave0> oil + metal filings + lime + goat
13:52 < typhoon> goatronica?
13:53 < Strogg> ooooh
13:53 < typhoon> man, i just can't bring myself to drink this thing... it reeks
                 of lawn clippings
13:53 < dave0> seriously?
13:53 < Strogg> typhoon: I don't know what you were thinking.. that ranks up
                there with sushi tea
13:53 < typhoon> yes, seriously... lemongrass tea smells like lemons and grass
13:53 < dave0> I've had lemongrass tea and it didn't smell like that
13:53 < typhoon> ugh... it tastes worse than it smells
13:53 < dave0> maybe they ran out of lemongrass and used lemon+grass
13:53 < Strogg> just because tea is yummy and japanese food is yummy, doesn't
                mean they are meant to be combined. hehe
13:54 < Strogg> maybe you put in too much milk. hehe
13:54  * typhoon runs screaming to the kitchen to pour it out and replace it
          with The Factory Coffee (tm)
13:56 < typhoon> a match made in flavour fusion hell
13:56 < Strogg> for some reason, the idea of sushi+ketchup just popped into my
                head.
13:56 < typhoon> lemon walrus armpit tea
13:57 < bartman> typhoon: have you ever had lemongrass?
13:57 < bartman> ... like in lemongrass soup
13:57 < typhoon> bartman: only chopped up small in noodles or something where
                 it wasn't the dominant flavour
13:57 < bartman> it's a pretty common spice in thai
13:57 < bartman> it smells like pledge
13:57 < bartman> if it's fresh, it should be quite a potent smell
13:58 < typhoon> bartman: and in some countries, it's sexy to slice open your
                 genitals and put rocks under the skin too
13:58 < bartman> huh?
13:58 -!- bartman changed the topic of #ghak to: <typhoon> it's sexy to slice
          open your genitals and put rocks under the skin
13:58  * Strogg recalls the guy that pierced his face with a bicycle. hehe
13:59 < Strogg> hehhehe
13:59 < typhoon> he probably eats lemongrass and/or lemongrass tea
13:59 < Strogg> hehe
