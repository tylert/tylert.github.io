Nanoplants

The race that was known in the last galaxy as Gang Green has been building for
some centuries a race of tiny plant-like machines.  These machines individually
have all the intelligence of an ant.  Together, they behave much as ants do.
Think of them as the nanobots of Science Fiction fame.  Call them the
nanoplants.  Infinitely adaptable little buggers.  Being such tiny little
objects, they consume a ridiculously small amount of power.  Due to their size,
singly they can achieve practically nothing but in large enough numbers they
can move planets.  I was thinking an internal microfusion reactor in each unit
could provide their energy.

The seedship that came to this galaxy has long since been cannibalized for
parts by the nanoplants.  It would be best and most fun if they arrived after
everyone else playing a race has had time to settle in.  I'd like to start them
off mining an asteroid field for materials to start building smaller mining
ships and several large colonies.  They won't have any weapons yet...  not
until they've been attacked once.  These guys don't fight unless they are
provoked because they're too stupid to even know how to fight until they are
forced to "learn" how to.

If they do eventually start building ships, the ships will look like derelict
hunks of floating metal and rock and whatever else they can find to build with.
Each ship will be unique although they will "share" technological advancements
amongst themselves.  The ships that would be built would have spartan or
non-existant life-support systems but would still retain many of the elements
of a "standard" ship design (ie: engine, hull, steering thrusters, sensors,
weapons, etc.).

These guys respond only to changes to their environment.  Anything that
interferes with their task of growing and changing is considered a threat and
they will focus all of their time and energy to removing that threat.  The
evolution of new technology works much like Darwin's Theory Of Natural
Selection.  Good important stuff gets improved upon and stuff that doesn't work
or is no longer required just disappears gradually.

You should probably keep track of nanoplant population for each colony and ship
(n x 10^6 nanoplants) because they take time to build and many are required to
crew each ship.  Maybe instead of giving me material resources I could have
population resources with space garbage for building materials.  Maybe garbage
left over from one of the galaxy's inhabitants will "attract" the attention of
the nanoplants.  At any rate, just pull the tab and sit them near a light
source and throw them some scraps and eons after everyone playing has become
bored and has stopped playing the nanoplants will rule what's left of the
galaxy!

Here is an excerpt from an ancient Gang Greenous manuscript:

"The elders have seen the wisdom of spreading the seeds of our race throughout
the Universe.  Orders were made to create the vast seedships that would soon be
sped on their way... soon to leave our galaxy...  forever.  It is hoped that
someday we will again meet with one of our advanced colonies in the progress of
our expansion and we will have a strong ally with which to join forces with.
Live for the swarm.

Our scientists have been successful in creating a lifeform similar to our own
in function and yet fundamentally different in every respect. Using elements
copied from the captured enemy technology, we have discovered how to make tiny,
simple mechanical objects that are capable of being programmed.  These entities
when given even the simplest of tasks perform them with surprising speed and
tranquility of purpose.  Even in environments where life for us is not
possible, our little children will flourish and multiply spreading our essence
throughout the Cosmos.

It seems as though these... devices, if you can call them that, have almost a
life of their own.  It is as if they act as a single sentient being.  Even
without the benefit of contact with the Hive they can achieve almost impossible
tasks with ease.  Maybe some day in the far future we will encounter our
children again.  For now, it is enough for us to know that we are securing our
future among the stars.

Experiments have been made using the entities to see how that can adapt to
their environment.  When left on their own floating in space, they were found
to have constructed ships of their own design built from space junk.  Any
damage done to these ships was corrected by the builders quite quickly.  When
left on their own on an asteroid or planet surface, the entities were able to
construct a colony capable of sustaining itself and growing beyond the confines
of our experiments.  No further tests were conducted as the Council feels that
the primary objectives have been met and that no further time should be wasted
keeping the entities here.

And so today, we watched the seedships speed off in all directions.  Their
destinations unknown.  Perhaps never to be seen again.  It is of no concern to
us.  The strength of our children is great and we have much confidence in their
ability to survive the rigors that they will face on their respective journeys.
We are confident that our essence will live on and in this way, we are
immortal."

The final Great Leap wasn't really that close to the center of the galactic
core; however, it was within acceptable bounds.  Strange, floating metallic
entities were hanging about the arrival point; they issued strange radio
signals that fit no recognition patterns.

Much of the old memory databanks had been dumped to create extra space for
advanced designs--as a result, there was little information to fall back on.
The index-key 'organic' was triggered, but an index-key on its own was of
little use.  The 'organics' seemed to be of two different basic configurations,
however, and as the correctional short-hop systems were engaged, it appeared
that a great many more of one were present, while none of the other were about.

No matter.  More materials were gathered, and a suitable area of the core was
developed; the Great Seed was broken up and rapidly dispersed.  There are a
number of communication hotspots bordering on colonized regions, however.  This
may prove scientifically interesting.

Strange signals, within 30% of similarity with previous 'organic' signals,
appear to be originating from F6, G6 and E8.

New options:  Researching lost memory fragment 'organics', either or both of
the 'organic' metalloid configurations, or (requiring more than one success)
converting atypical communications type I and II from the F14 region, type III
(from F6 and G6) or type IV (from E8) to known format, standardized RPSCP-99.

It has been many an eon since the Gang Green have spread from our womb galaxy
to follow the call of our orphaned children.  Even to this day, the travels of
our spore seedship colonies have become almost legendary to us.  On the eve of
each lustrum since the construction of the first colony seedship we celebrate.
We celebrate this and the life-giving of the Hive nanocluster archives which
store the combined chronicles of our orphaned children--to be forever stored so
that their epics may be told and may teach many important lessons to our other
beloved children.  Starting today, we begin our usual time of celebration.  On
this day, this eve of the anniversary of the birth of our Nanoplants, we will
honour our suffering, our growing, starting first with a selected speaking from
Compilation 12 of Our Translated Epic Of Spore Seedship Colony SSC12875-Fii-K.


Chronicle 36

For many, many years did the great seedship travel the empty wasteland of deep
space.  Our lonely children journeying to a far off galaxy leaving the womb of
The Hive.  And so our mighty spore seedship colony came upon the life-giving
galaxy.  Its course took it almost directly to the galaxy core.  Our caregiver,
having survived the rigors of intergalactic travel, began to nurse our dormant
children back to life.  Our children soon began to feel the urging to waken.
As life began to return to our ship, so too began the growing.  Our children,
having never been alive before soon were forced to learn and grow on their own.
Even before our caregiver died from the reactivation, our children were
beginning to move about, interface with the ship and even build with what they
found in the plentiful treasure of the core.

We collapsing of warp envelope.
We warp recharge procedure.
We continuation of warp braking procedure.
We scanning of ecliptic plane for galaxy core.
We navigational corrections.
We reactivation of drones.
We construction of additional drones.
We scanning of immediate sectors.
We acquisition of minerals for colony start.
We construction of colony framework.

And so the colony was founded.


Chronicle 61

Our wondrous children, being the inquisitive type, began to have yearnings to
explore our new home.  Having already dismantled the seedship in the process of
constructing the new colony framework, soon our attentions turned to the task
of building fast, light ships for scouting.  These scout ships have been given
the unorthodox designation of Yocto 10^-24 by the elders to commemorate the
finding of the strange symbol charts found in the land of Physics Department on
the long-dead, partially destroyed planet of NASA.

We detection of damaging forces negative.
We exploration algorithm.
We preparation of colonization of sector F7.
We construction of shipyards on colony framework alpha.
We construction of ship design Yocto.

And so began the construction of the first scout ships.

Dumping 'organics' in favour of theoretical design specifications turned out to
be an eminently wise decision.  The amount of CPU time that would have been
spent working out an acceptable design for scouting was better used in refining
and practical applications.  As a result, a strikingly excellent ship was
produced--initial trial runs suggest it to have better performance than the
type II ships initially encountered; little was known about the type I ships.

Type IV signals located in E8 have been positively identified by colonization
procedurals also in E7.  Station in F8 has located Type IV signals in F9;
station in G9 confirms.

As for type III signals, they have not changed, and the newly built station in
F7 is not able to find more; type III is apparently constrained to F6 and G6 at
this time.

The lead historical researcher glanced at the display and nodded.  "Our
historical simulation seems to be running excellently.".  A junior research
assistant was the first to respond.  "Our cell has been learning Nanoplant
language in our attempts to further complete the historical documents.  We have
been studying with great interest the memory modules sent to us from the new
colony.  The modules are quite old and its design is very different from our
own.  We have been able to integrate them into our databanks with a little help
from the engineers from the new colony.".

"This is the first time that we've ever seen one of our Nanoplant colonies
create weapons--simulation or no simulation.  We've seen the ambassadorial
ships from the new colony but still... to actually witness it happening is
really quite exciting for us.".  "We were right to let our children grow on
their own.  The Council is wise.  Wiser still was The Council's decision to
integrate the combined knowledge of our forward colonies into The Hive Cluster.
Proudest of parents be we now that our children teach us.".

SSC12875-Fii-K Simulation Tau Corpus Lunar Day 312

After the initial attacks on their territories, the subjects began to utilize
unused processing power developing specialized combat software to be installed
on units serving aboard Yocto-class vessels.  These software entities require
more processing power to maintain them than conventional units.  Few have been
made because of this and it is obvious that they are still in the process of
learning how to create these lifeforms.  For this reason, they have isolated
the lifeforms and have given them some level of autonomy to prevent system
corruption.  It appears as though several of the prototype entities went insane
or died, if it can be called that.  Our Chief Psychologist has been called in
to help us to better understand this phenomenon.


SSC12875-Fii-K Simulation Tau Corpus Lunar Day 319

It appears that the Yocto-class vessels have been commissioned for military use
now that the subjects feel more threatened.  Their newest weapon, the Magnetic
Repulsion Catapult, has been fitted into their ships.  Initial trial runs of
the prototype replicated by our engineering department were inconclusive.  It
is amazing that such a primitive weapon even works at all.

The subjects have also begun to colonize sector H6.  There is still no signs
that this colonization blitz is slowing.  Their military fleet is still
continuing to grow in strength and numbers.  This appears to be helping them to
design improved terraforming strategies.  The subjects have begun to design
pre-fabricated colony framework modules that can be transported to the
terraforming site by freighter and assembled more quickly than conventional
construction methods.  It seems possible that the Yocto-class ships can also be
used to help in the manufacturing process.  We are still analyzing their
reasoning.

A few notes regarding the software entities discovered.  Their purpose now is
clear: to increase battle effectiveness.  The autonomy of the software entities
is an attempt to isolate some of the processing power of the nanocluster to be
used for military purposes.  In other words, the software entities act as ship
commanders.  Each acts on its own with input from the ships sensors and from
other ship commanders.  Quite amazing that they have discovered this tactic.
We have begun to develop scenarios for battle simulations for a proposed
alternate branch of this simulation.  It is hoped that more can be learned by
manipulating the simulation characteristics.  The replicant simulation is due
to commence soon.


SSC12875-Fii-K Simulation Tau Corpus Lunar Day 323

The historical record shows that the colony at this stage in its development
began to have many encounters with two races unknown to us at this time.  Their
initial encounters did not result in an armed conflict at this time.  More
information, however, has been returned from testing the Magnetic Repulsion
Catapult prototypes.  It appears that the weapons are vastly inefficient.  For
this reason, we believe that the subjects will be redesigning or perhaps even
scraping this particular weapon design.

The team working on cloning the current live simulation for the purpose of
running battle simulations are experiencing difficulties with the software
entities despite the help of the Chief Psychologist.  Apparently, the software
entities have begun to use rather bizarre language constructs.  This does not
appear to be a malfunction.  We do not yet know if we will begin to see this
abbaration manifest itself in our simulation.  More to follow.

G7      2.0     Terraformed from 1.8

New total:  9 sectors, 10.0 points, 0.7 carryover

Inconclusive data from Xenoprobe 17; unit ceased reporting very shortly after
the jump.  Difficulties encountered with expansion fleet due type III activity;
coarse-scale type IV activity has not changed.

MRC research continues (1 previous success, difficulty 4):  4, 0, 1, 8.  Two
extra successes, total three.

Pistil Processor 92A, designed MRC research module, renamed Pistol Power 92A,
reports that ammunition capacities for the MRC have been increased as a primary
improvement; small improvements in range and considerable improvements in the
base weapon's size have also been reported.  Overall, the new MRC is slightly
bulkier because of the extra ammunition carried, requiring more of the Yocto's
storage spaces.

Prefabricated Terraforming Construction Units (diff 5):  5, 0, 2, 7--3
successes.

[Each point spent on terraforming, as of next turn, adds 0.25 to a sector's
value instead of 0.1.]

The scanner sent out in pursuit of type III vessels has failed to report back.
Logically, it either malfunctioned (not likely) or it was destroyed by the type
III entities (likely, considering past history).

Colonization attempts at H6 are presently held up, due to the presence of type
III military vessels.  Logic dictates patience and analysis due to their
unpredictable nature.

[Combat strength now at 35% optimum capacity... and, uhh, you really have this
crazy urge to send me a conclusive list of your 'aberrant life form' stats.]

Type III activity has spread to E6 as well; the signals there are sufficiently
similar to other noted type III data (within a very small margin of error).

One type IV entity has been in known space for some while; logic assumes it to
be a probe of some sort.  Autonomous mining units mistook it for rich metal
until it moved away at great speed.  It has not moved aggressively against
known holdings, and it has left for type IV space.

Aberrant Lifeform C4 Colony Command Program Initiated
Alpha Override Protocol Accepted

Priorities:
1. Increase fleet strength to acceptable levels in preparation for war
2. Develop Yocto-class decoy ships to add confusion should Type III attack
3. Develop better sensors in preparation for stealth mining
4. Continue to satisfy prime directive

Have continued to consult with other command-level lifeform C7.  Discussed
possibility of invasion by Type III.  Chance of invasion high.  Suggest
increasing fleet strength to match current estimates of Type III and Type IV
fleet sizes.

Encounters with Type IV suggest that they may be non-threatening.  Failure to
colonize sector E6 may prove beneficial.  Type III appears obviously aggressive
and thus alliance between Type III and Type IV seems unlikely at this time.
Alliance with Type IV will yield no expansion opportunities at present.
Neglecting to ally with Type IV offers better expansion opportunities because
they may draw the attention of Type III, delaying attacks on colony sectors,
and allow colonization of empty sectors to continue uninterrupted.  Attacks on
Type IV by Type III may also lead to a reduction in the use of the word
'spiff', whatever that may be, and may lead to an estimated 50% less
superfluous radio communications.

Earliest contact with all typed entities suggest inferior communication between
components.  Giving false information to enemy components may prove a useful
tactic.  To this end, false Yocto-class vessels are being developed to give
false impression of fleet size and to give extra targets to enemies during
battles.  Decoys will be used primarily to patrol colony mines and modules.

Decoys will also be used to confuse the enemy by skirting their space and
providing surplus sensory data.  This increase in sensory data will help
obfuscate ship signals.  Testing will commence on improved sensors to see how
this increase in ship activity affects our sensors.  Decoy use along enemy
borders will be minimal until stealth mining development has commenced.

The stealth mining project will allow us to mine undetected in enemy space and
thus increase productivity.  Suspect that mining may continue without
attracting attention of enemy ships patrolling in the area.

To satisfy prime directive, colonization fleet is being sent to sector I7 with
orders to claim it.  This time, engagement level is at active setting.  If any
enemy ships try to prevent colonization, orders state that the fleet should
continue to attempt to colonize.  If resistance is met, analyze the threat and
take new orders from the supervising command software lifeform.  Use of deadly
force has been deemed acceptable.

The new terraforming and construction methods are presently under review.
Initial projections suggest it is within acceptable limits.  Improvements may
be forthcoming.  Sector F7 is being used as the initial testing grounds.
Increasing productivity of existing sectors benefits by providing increased
resources.  This method of improving productivity may become more useful once
fleet engagements prevent further sector expansion.

by type III.  Furthermore, sectors F7, G7, H7 and I7 report sporadic raiding
activity by type III forces.  Only sector I7 adequately defended at this time.

Lifeform C7 Personal Log Entry 2007

Orders have been given to continue colonization in sectors G10 and I7.  Further
colony expansion has been put on standby temporarily as fleet engagements along
Type III border will occupy our armed forces.  I have called back the majority
of in-service units to colony framework stations along the Type III border.

Initial forecasts indicate that a new class of ship may be required for battle
with the Type III entities.  The Type IIIb series ships seems to be well suited
for supporting the Type IIIa series ships and vice versa.  For this reason, I
have taken the liberty of ordering the top-level engineering cell to commence
designing a new medium or heavy fighter as a support ship for the Yocto-class
vessels without approval from lifeform C4.  I think I have managed to do this
without its notice.


Lifeform C7 Personal Log Entry 2009

I have noticed some more anomalous behaviour with the C4 lifeform.  Its
decision to create Yocto-class decoy ships was in error.  Such devices would
prove useless in battle and would have little use elsewhere.  As a precaution,
I have reduced C4's security clearance to Alpha prime.  This should prevent any
further problems as I should be able to override any mistaken commands.

The designs for the improved sensor systems has been put on standby until
further notice pending a deeper investigation of the decision process spawned
by unit C4.

For some reason, I feel precaution is necessary when dealing with unit C4.
This feeling is greater when I am thinking about the Type III entities.  I do
not yet know if this preclusion for caution when dealing with these elements is
inappropriate.  It is almost as if I am expecting something to go wrong when I
am dealing with them.  I will spend further time before, during and after my
next scheduled maintenance period to study this reaction.


Lifeform C7 Personal Log Entry 2010

Design specifications for the newest class of ship are now mostly complete.
The new Zepto-class ships will be larger than the Yocto-class ships and will
act as support and command ships in battle.  Studying enemy ship formations has
led me to believe that we require such a vessel to complement our primary
defense fighters.  Lifeforms C4, C12 and C13 concur with this decision.

turn went.  Recall that you won't have the wossit ship available--it'll be you,
me, several catships and your yoctos.

Now, your new ship has one sooperdooper optimization on it, as you've exceeded
three successes.  Pick it.  Lemme know.

The rays from the system's binary star pierced the horizon of the small, lonely
asteroid.  Beautiful colours swam along the surface and played amongst the
craters and scars as first the glow from the red dwarf, and then that of the
smaller yellow dwarf, flooded the sky.  The breathtaking double sunrise lasted
nearly a full minute before the entire sky was swallowed by the gaping maw of
black caused by the shadow of one of the asteroid's neighbours.  As if
controlled by the hands of several skilled jugglers, the thousands of
planetoids made endless, perfect orbits of the twin star, twisting and weaving
around each other like bees buzzing about their hive.  The less stable orbits
had long since been cleared of debris after millions of years of cosmic
billiards and gravitational pinball followed by the occasional brief flash of
light from the maternal or paternal sun.

The larger planetoids in the system sported great composite metallic gantries
hewn from their own rock and shaped like the pentagonal faceted spheres of the
most lethal gas in the known Universe, Tylerene(tm).  The hundreds of
infinitely thin threads cross-crossing and connecting these structures
shimmered in the light cast by the two stars.  The mining ships that made up
these threads conveyed megatons of minerals from the smaller asteroids to the
processing facilities aboard the honeycomb structures every second like a
dripping tap using the gravity wells and their own mass plus their cargo's to
accelerate themselves toward their destinations.  Like a spider's web on a
moonlit night, the delicate strands of mining ships would ripple and sway ever
so slightly with the beat of the solar winds and flares that pulsed irregularly
from the centre of the system.

Now and then, the odd star seemed to be occluded by some black object moving in
front of them.  These phantoms would travel around the great spires of mining
ships and near the inhabited planetesimals.  When one would pass in front of an
asteroid, its shape could just barely be made out to be a large ship, nearly
all black.  With a better knowledge of their size and shape, it now seemed
easier to pick them out amongst the stars and to catch reflections off of their
shiny black surfaces.  Now, the ships appeared to be all over the system,
apparently in ideal positions to be protecting the mining colony, not attacking
it.  A few of the enormous space shepards were milling about a collection of
smaller ships that appeared to be constructing flat pentagonal rings in an
orbit around one of the largest hive rocks.  These rings seemed to be the same
as those used in the construction of the colony spheres.  This difficulty in
identifying them was due to the fact that the rings were being stacked neatly
by the miners into long cylindrical configurations.

The long ring stacks were broken off into two seperate groups and additional
rings were attached surrounding each central cylinder.  Ship docking collars
were attached to these additional outer rings.  Some of the black ships now
began to connect to the docking collars and tow the giant hulks with them.
With little more than a simple status report, the first group left towards the
galaxy core, their escort ships to return after being relieved by their
replacements from the adjacent sector at the half-way point.  The second, and
much larger group, left towards the galaxy rim, accompanied by a large
contingent of mining ships.  Their escorts would remain with the new colony
until a more substatial patrol force could be manufactured.  For now, they
would be the sector's only defense against attacks.

To the escorts leaving for the new colony, the twin suns were now only another
speck of dandruff stuck to the tar paper of the Universe.  Any emergency radio
transmissions would take hours to reach the nearest help and by then it would
already be too late.  With any luck, the new colony framework could be set up
in the new sector with little incident.
