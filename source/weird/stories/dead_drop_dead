The Dead Drop

A brisk fall breeze caused the swings in the playground to sway and creak.
The boards over the windows of the abandoned elementary school slapped loudly
against the empty window frames.  The whole park was eerily silent except for
the crackling of the leaves as they were swept along by the wind.  Great
shadows were cast by the morning sun glinting off the towering skyscrapers
that had encircled the token greenspace here in the hollwed-out heart of this
once thriving neighbourhood at the centre of the bustling metropolis.

A dark, hooded figure stepped onto the grassy curb and stalked into the park
proper.  He pulled his jacket closer around his neck as a small gust picked
up.  He briefly stifled a racking cough and stumbled a bit before regaining
his composure and continuing on.

The figure headed towards a nearby drinking fountain and stooped down to take
a drink.  He stood up and carefully wiped the fountain clean with his
handkerchief.
