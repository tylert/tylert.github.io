---Scene 1---
Brother Paul, the senior dude is talking with a journalist about the work that
is being done at the brother's monestary.  Paul explains some of the
humanitarian and other work that they do there.
---
"So, Brother Paul, let me get this straight..."

"Simply amazing", Paul thought.  "How is it that journalists are able to be
presented with the facts but simply refuse to believe that nothing sinister is
going on behind the scenes?"  He often mused about the media in the outside
world.

---Scene 2---
We get a pleasant view of monestary life on a nice, warm summer morning.
---

"And how can you concentrate knowing that the sister's monestary is only a
few kilometers away from here?"


"Look, they come here to get away from a law system that treats them like
dirt, cruel pimps, crazy johns, drugs, excessive violence, family problems,
whatever.  We don't ask them about their past lives."

"I mean, how would you like standing on a street corner in bad weather and
stand all that abuse every day?"

"Here, they get a warm, clean bed, respect, all the medical care they could
ever want and a decent job where they get to help other human beings.  Can you
blame them for wanting to come here?"
