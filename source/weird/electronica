In case you didn't know, German electronica is a bit on the strange side when
it comes to lyrics (for lack of a better word).

"Milk the tard / Get paid the lime / Spread the net / To catch the man..."

Today is officially the end of year number 27 for me.  Just another
work/weekday as far as I can tell.  I will be officially "aged 27 years"  at
19:20 this evening.  If I was full of scotch, I'm sure I'd be quite valuable
and sought-after--if you didn't mind the bizarre aftertaste.

At any rate, postponing the execution of celebratory shenanigans until Friday
the 13th is compelling in an of itself--not to mention the fact that it is a
prelude to a weekend and as such provides more hours in which to
shenaniganize.  contains(weekend, shenanigans);

So, if there are folks residing at your domicile or other select sentient
beings you can think of who would be willing to shenaniganate on Friday the
13th, this would be a most fortuitous development.  I have no preferences on
what form these activities should take at this time.  Ingesting food of some
form, certainly.  Other stuff, to be sure although after the year I've had
thus far, it won't take much to whelm me at this point.  I'm thinking some
kind of random biking might be nice.

It seems that I have just run out of bland tea.  I shall now attempt to get
some more bland tea to remedy this.  I will attempt to initiate a telephonic
exchange with your locale either tonight or tomorrow night.
