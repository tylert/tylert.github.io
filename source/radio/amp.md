    15V voltage supply, 1MHZ to 1000MHZ can work frequency range.

    1, the supply voltage Voltage: DC + 12 \~ 15V (typical 15V 0.4-0.6A) pad
    interface
    2, working frequency FREq: 1MHZ-1000MHZ, input and output impedance: SMA
    50 ohms;
    3, the maximum output power Power: 34.8dbm (3W)
    4, typical power gain Gain: 35 dB (\>300M gain slightly decreased)
    5, the maximum input power: \<+7dBm
    6, module size: length \* width \* height 46 \* 32 \* 15mm

    Third, the measured power indicators
