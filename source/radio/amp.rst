Be sure to connect the input and output and then power on, the input power is
less than 10dBm. Impedance 50 ohms

First, product application:

      Broadband RF power amplification, suitable for HF FM VHF UHF FM
transmission of various radio applications, short-wave FM remote control toys
Radio walkie-talkie, digital radio, etc., can output up to 3 watts, 15V voltage
supply, 1MHZ to 1000MHZ can work frequency range.

Second, technical indicators

1, the supply voltage Voltage: DC + 12 ~ 15V (typical 15V  0.4-0.6A) pad interface

2, working frequency FREq: 1MHZ-1000MHZ, input and output impedance: SMA 50 ohms;

3, the maximum output power Power: 34.8dbm (3W)

4, typical power gain Gain: 35 dB (>300M gain slightly decreased)

5, the maximum input power: <+7dBm

6, module size: length * width * height 46 * 32 * 15mm

Third, the measured power indicators

2-300M +34dBm max 3W

    300-500M >+32dBm

    1000M +30dBm

Note: RF power amplifier is a wearing part, it must be connected to the input
and output and pay attention to the impedance matching and power-on test.
