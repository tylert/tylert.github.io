Wish List
=========

* Raspberry Pi units


Arcade Stuff
------------

I am considering building an arcade cabinet.  I am still in the process of
acquiring a few odds and ends.

Some of the parts are available on Amazon.ca
(https://www.amazon.ca/gp/registry/wishlist/2WGXDYRRMM44V).

The hardest part seems to be the wooden shell that goes around everything.
Maybe a broken arcade system would be nice to get so it can be given new life.


Radio Stuff
-----------

I pretty well have everything I need as far as radio gear is concerned,
however, I tend to re-gift lots of stuff to newly-licensed hams.

Stuff that I tend to watch out for includes:

* Morse code straight keys (cheap ones)
* 2m/VHF 50W FM transceivers and mobile antennas (working)
* WiFi hardware capable of running or working with AREDN/BBHN/OpenWRT
* other cool stuff that can be donated to new hams
